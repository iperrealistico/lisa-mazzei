This work unfolds as a series of narrative fragments, stills from films that were never made. Echoing the rhythm of storyboards and drawing inspiration from cinematic language and photo-novels, each tableaux explore different atmospheres, time periods, and emotional states, all through female protagonists. The images function as open-ended visual fictions focused on the figure of the female and her relationship through years with loneliness, nostalgia and mystery in different imaginaries.
