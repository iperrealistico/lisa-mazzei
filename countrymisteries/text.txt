“Country Mysteries: Blue Hour Tales” originates from the need to convey the echoes of the places the artist belongs to, through a subjective interpretation that evokes the charm and mystery of rural landscapes.
The story unfolds through images of the Italian countryside, specifically the Garfagnana valley, a region in the northern part of Tuscany.

Drawing from the cinematographic and literary tradition that connects liminal spaces with mystery narratives, Country Mysteries: Blue Hour Tales becomes a contemporary visual exploration that merges cinematic staged photography with documentation of everyday enigma, balancing subjective and objective perspectives.

A sense of mystery permeates the everyday landscape — the same timeless presence that has inhabited woods and mountains for centuries.
The young protagonists attempt to interpret the enigmatic language of the rural world, confronting the impossibility of fully communicating with it. The subjects appear suspended in moments of apparent stillness, where action becomes a form of both external and internal investigation.

Country Mysteries: Blue Hour Tales is a journey between fiction and reality, identity and place, a visual archive of a motionless tale.
